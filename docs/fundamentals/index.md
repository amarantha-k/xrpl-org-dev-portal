# What is the XRP Ledger?

The XRP Ledger is a blockchainâ€”an online system for payments and more, powered by a community without a central leader. Anyone can connect their computer to the peer-to-peer network that manages the ledger. The XRP Ledger is the home of XRP, a digital asset designed to bridge the world's many currencies. The XRP Ledger has a variety of other features that contribute to the _Internet of Value_: an emerging world in which money moves the way information does today.

## What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is kind of like a shared database, consisting of "blocks" that describe the state of the database at one point in time, with a secure link back to the previous block. Each block also contains enough information that anyone can reconstruct it according to the rules of the blockchain. Crucially, this means that every copy of the blockchain's data is equally valid and authoritative: it's not important where you get the data from, because the data speaks for itself.

Blockchains are useful for the Internet of Value in a few ways. First, they don't need to be tied to a specific country or business, so they can provide a neutral ground for users who have very little in common, and you don't have to go through a specific gatekeeper to start using them. Second, they consistently achieve very high uptime, so you can rely on them to be online and functional whenever you need them. Various blockchains have other properties that can be helpful and beneficial for use cases.

## How is the XRP Ledger Different from Other Blockchains?

The XRP Ledger processes transactions fast, both in terms of total transactions over time and in terms of how long it takes for a transaction's outcome to be finalized. It's also inexpensive: a transaction that might take multiple hours and $50 USD to settle on the Bitcoin network would typically settle in less than 5 seconds and cost less than $0.01 on the XRP Ledger.

The XRP Ledger is also the world's first blockchain to be carbon neutral, which is possible because of the unique, energy-efficient consensus mechanism that powers it.

## What is XRP?

XRP is part of a new class of money which includes Bitcoin and other _cryptocurrencies_. These digital assets are natively digital and online, so they can be used across any distance by any system with an internet connection. They are powered by decentralized systems, which means that no one has the power to roll back transactions, freeze balances, or block someone from using them.

XRP is tied to the XRP Ledger network and the rules that define it. 100 billion XRP were created alongside the start of the network, and no more can be created. XRP plays an important role in protecting the XRP Ledger from spam attacks because users have to destroy a small amount of XRP to send transactions.

## What are Tokens?

Tokens are representations of "value" given a digital shape. The XRP Ledger's rules allow anyone to create any tokens they want, for any use case you can think of. These can include digital representations of other assets, backed by balances outside the ledger; records of community credit and debts; or purely digital tokens created in the XRP Ledger, imbued with whatever meaning their creators gave them.

Tokens in the XRP Ledger can be fungible or non-fungible. Fungible tokens are interchangeable, so that any unit is as good as any other; non-fungible tokens are each unique. Due to these differences, the rules applying to each type of token are different as well. But for either type of token, users can hold them, send them to one another, and even trade them for other tokens or for XRP in the XRP Ledger's on-chain decentralized exchange.
