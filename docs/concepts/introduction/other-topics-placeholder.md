## What Are Sidechains?

A sidechain is an independent ledger with its own consensus algorithm, transaction types, and rules.  It is connected to a specific instance of the XRPL, then splits to create its own independent blockchain. Federation enables value in the form of XRP and other tokens to move efficiently between a sidechain and an XRP Ledger (usually Mainnet, but sidechains can connect with Testnet or Devnet for testing). Federated sidechains operate without compromising the speed, efficiency, and throughput of the public Mainnet.


## What Are NFTs?

Most of the items you trade on XRPL are _fungible,_ meaning that you can swap one with another item of equal value without a problem (for example, XRP for another cryptocurrency). Non-fungible items are items that are totally unique or issued in limited supply. Real estate is non-fungible, as is an original piece of art.

A current amendment to the XRPL under consideration would allow you to create non-fungible tokens (NFTokens or NFTs) and trade them with other accounts. You can also create a marketplace where you would curate and offer NFTokens for sale, with the proceeds going both to the original creator of the item with a commission for the broker.

You mint a NFToken with a transaction that creates a record of the token on the XRPL and a link to the digital asset it represents. Transferring the NFToken to another account transfers ownership of the item the NFToken represents.


## What Can I Do with My Account?

These are some examples of how you can use your XRPL account.

* Send and receive XRP.
* Send and receive other issued currencies.
* Send virtual checks.
* Create an escrow.
* Create and trade NFTs (amendment pending)

## What Is the DEX?

A decentralized exchange (DEX) coordinates large-scale trading of crypto assets between multiple users. They do so using automated algorithms rather than requiring a middleman between buyers and sellers. Removing the intermediaries reduces costs, typically at great savings to both parties.

An exchange typically involves one party creating an offer to trade one currency for another (for example, XRP for USD). The system tries to match the offer with one or more matching offers (one or more offers to exchange USD for XRP). The DEX returns prospective matches, and the parties have the option of accepting the trade.
